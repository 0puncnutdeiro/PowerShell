# How to Enhance Your Flight Simulator Experience with GSX Pro
 
If you are a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, you might be interested in adding more realism and immersion to your flights. One way to do that is to use GSX Pro, a ground service add-on that simulates several operations on the ground, such as pushback, catering, refueling, baggage loading, deicing, and more.

GSX Pro is developed by FSDreamTeam, a company that specializes in quality products for flight simulator. GSX Pro works with every airport, both default and third-party, and supports all default airplanes and many popular third-party airplanes. You can customize the vehicles and liveries according to your location and preferences, and enjoy the realistic animations and sounds of the ground crew.
 
GSX Pro also integrates with SimBrief, a flight planning tool that allows you to generate realistic flight plans and dispatches. GSX Pro can use the information from SimBrief to automatically set the number of passengers, the fuel quantity, and the cargo weight for your flight. You can also use the Live Update feature to keep GSX Pro updated with new supported airplanes and airports.
 
To use GSX Pro, you need to purchase it from FSDreamTeam's website[^1^]. You can also download a free trial version that works for 15 minutes at any airport. Once you install GSX Pro, you can access it from the ATC menu in Flight Simulator 2020. You can then request any service you need from the ground crew, and watch them perform it with realistic behavior.
 
GSX Pro is a great way to enhance your flight simulator experience and make it more realistic and enjoyable. Whether you fly for fun or for training, GSX Pro can add a new dimension to your flights and make you feel like a real pilot.
  
In this article, we will show you some examples of how GSX Pro can enhance your flight simulator experience. We will use the default Boeing 747-8 as our airplane, and fly from Vienna International Airport (LOWW) to Frankfurt Airport (EDDF).
 
Before we start our flight, we need to plan it using SimBrief. We enter our departure and arrival airports, our flight number, our airplane type, and our preferred route. SimBrief then generates a realistic flight plan and dispatch for us, with information such as the fuel required, the payload, the weather, the NOTAMs, and more. We can download the flight plan in various formats, such as PDF, XML, or FMS.
 
Once we have our flight plan ready, we launch Flight Simulator 2020 and load our airplane at Vienna International Airport. We set up our cockpit and avionics according to the flight plan, and then we open the ATC menu and request GSX services. We can see a list of available services, such as pushback, catering, refueling, boarding, deboarding, baggage loading, cargo loading, deicing, and follow-me car.

We start by requesting catering service. We see a catering truck approaching our airplane from behind. The truck stops near the left rear door of the airplane, and a crew member gets out and connects a hose to the door. We then see food and drinks being loaded into the airplane. The crew member then disconnects the hose and gets back into the truck. The truck then drives away from the airplane.
 
Next, we request refueling service. We see a fuel truck approaching our airplane from the right side. The truck stops near the right wing of the airplane, and a crew member gets out and connects a hose to the fuel port. We then see a fuel counter on our screen, showing us how much fuel is being pumped into the airplane. We can also see the fuel price per liter in real time. The crew member then disconnects the hose and gets back into the truck. The truck then drives away from the airplane.
 
Next, we request boarding service. We see a bus approaching our airplane from the front. The bus stops near the left front door of the airplane, and a crew member gets out and opens the door. We then see passengers walking out of the bus and into the airplane. We can also see their luggage being loaded into a baggage cart by another crew member. The passengers have different walking motions and gestures, making them look more realistic. The crew member then closes the door and gets back into the bus. The bus then drives away from the airplane.
 
Next, we request cargo loading service. We see a loader approaching our airplane from behind. The loader stops near the left rear cargo door of the airplane, and a crew member gets out and opens the door. We then see containers and pallets being loaded into the airplane by another crew member using a conveyor belt. The containers and pallets have different shapes and sizes, depending on our cargo weight. The crew member then closes the door and gets back into the loader. The loader then drives away from the airplane.
